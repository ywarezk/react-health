## EX Todo list

- Create a new app using `create-react-app`
- Add a new component called `TodoList`
- That component should use the hook `useEffect` to send a request to the server: `https://nztodo.herokuapp.com/api/tasks/?format=json` after the component is initialized
- when you get the response back you need to save it in the state (you will have to use the hook `useState`)
- The component should display a `ul-li` list of all the items the server returned.
